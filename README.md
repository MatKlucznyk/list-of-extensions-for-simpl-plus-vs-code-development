# list-of-extensions-for-simpl-plus-vs-code-development
A list of extensions that I find useful when developing for S+ in VS Code

sentry07.crestron-splus - This is a language package for programming Crestron SIMPL+ module. It has syntax highlighting, document formatting, snippets for a lot of S+ functions and code blocks, build tasks to compile your code, and a shortcut for the S+ help file. After installing the extension, please open your VSCode Settings (CTRL-Comma) and search for Splus and verify/update the file locations in there.
